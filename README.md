# Gauge Chart

Gauge charts, also known as dial charts or speedometer charts, use needles to show information as a reading on a dial. On a gauge chart, the value for each needle is read against the colored data range or chart axis. This chart type is often used in executive dashboard reports to show key business indicators.
